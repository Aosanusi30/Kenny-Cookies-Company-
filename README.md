# Introduction
This data was gotten from Alex YouTube Channel. And it contains four (4) excel sheets. Power BI was used to clean, analyze and visualize the report.

***Disclaimer***: *The company 'Kenny Cookies Company' is an imaginary and do not in anyway relates to an actual company.*

# Data Cleaning 
The dataset contains messy data where the company ID and Company Name were typed together and needs to be splited. For the Company ID and Company Name to be on a separate column, split by delimiter (space) was used to split the data. The data type were changed to their appropriate data type; like 
- date for order date and ship date
- Revenue and cost to currency 
- creating of profile column by subtraction revenue from cost and data type currency. 
- days to ship column was added by substrating ship date from order date.
- days of the week was created for both ship date and order date
